  git clone https://github.com/sohelhussain/sundown.git
```

2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
Go to the project directory

```bash

```

3. Explore the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to understand the structure and logic of the project.

4. Install or link cdn any necessary dependencies, such as GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and Locomotive, using npm or yarn.

cdn links-

gsap

```bash

Locomotive

(1) JS
```bash
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/locomotive-scroll@3.5.4/dist/locomotive-scroll.js"></script>
Start the server
```
(2) CSS
```bash
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm locomotive-scroll@3.5.4/dist/locomotive-scroll.css"/>
```

and makeshore you use this loco function in JavaScript for locomotive code are working properly with scrollTrigger.

```bash
const loco = () => {
  gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

  // Using Locomotive Scroll from Locomotive https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll

  const locoScroll = new LocomotiveScroll({
    el: document.querySelector("#main"),
    smooth: true,
  });
  // each time Locomotive Scroll updates, tell ScrollTrigger to update too (sync positioning)
  locoScroll.on("scroll", ScrollTrigger.update);

  // tell ScrollTrigger to use these proxy methods for the "#main" element since Locomotive Scroll is hijacking things
  ScrollTrigger.scrollerProxy("#main", {
    scrollTop(value) {
      return arguments.length
        ? locoScroll.scrollTo(value, 0, 0)
        : locoScroll.scroll.instance.scroll.y;
    }, // we don't have to define a scrollLeft because we're only scrolling vertically.
    getBoundingClientRect() {
      return {
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
      };
    },
    // LocomotiveScroll handles things completely differently on mobile devices - it doesn't even transform the container at all! So to get the correct behavior and avoid jitters, we should pin things with position: fixed on mobile. We sense it by checking to see if there's a transform applied to the container (the LocomotiveScroll-controlled element).
    pinType: document.querySelector("#main").style.transform
      ? "transform"
      : "fixed",
  });

  // each time the window updates, we should refresh ScrollTrigger and then update LocomotiveScroll.
  ScrollTrigger.addEventListener("refresh", () => locoScroll.update());

  // after everything is set up, refresh() ScrollTrigger and update LocomotiveScroll because padding may have been added for pinning, etc.
  ScrollTrigger.refresh();
};
loco();
```

5. Start the development server and preview the project in your browser.

```bash
  go live with "live server" extantion
```

6. Make modifications and enhancements as desired to personalize the project.
